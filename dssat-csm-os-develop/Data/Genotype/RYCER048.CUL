! Coefficients used in the Cropsim-Ceres model differ from those used
! in DSSAT Versions 3.5 and 4.0. They can be calculated (approximately) from 
! V3.5 coefficients as follows:

! P1V   = P1V(v3.5)*10 
! P1D   = P1D(V3.5)*20
! P5    = P5(V3.5)*20 + 430
! G1    = G1(V3.5)*5 + 5
! G2    = (G2(V3.5)*0.35+0.65) * P5/20
! G3    = G3(V3.5)*0.7 
! PHINT = PHINT(V3.5)

! Converted coefficients,and those listed below,should always be
! tested by using them with real experiments and comparing model 
! outputs with measured values.
